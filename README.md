This documentation is current for version 1.0.0 and above.

RunCommand extension runs scripts on VMs send by the RunCommand operation to a Linux VM.
These scripts can be used to bootstrap/install software, run administrative tasks, or run

download a script file from the Internet or Azure Storage.
The extension is intended to be used internally and should not be directly deployed by the clients.
